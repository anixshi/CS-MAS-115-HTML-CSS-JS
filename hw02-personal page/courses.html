	<h1><a href="assign2.html">Anika's</a> Fall 2017 Schedule</h1>
	<p>When I'm not <a href="hobbies.html">sleeping, watching TV, eating, or 
	venturing into Boston</a>, I'm in one of these classes: ARTH 100, CS 115, 
	AFR 265 or LAT 200. 
	</p>
	
<!--Going more in depth into the classes I'm taking this semester.-->

	<h2 class="coursesf2017">ARTH 100 with Prof. Greene</h2>
		<p>ARTH 100 is an introductory Art History class that explores issues 
		like cultural appropriation, race, and gender. There's weekly lectures, 
		readings, blog posts, as well as field trips required for the class. 
		So far, I'm enjoying ARTH 100 because I'm being forced to rethink how 
		I view and analyze art. 
		</p>
			
	
	<h2 class="coursesf2017">CS 115 with Prof. Metaxas & Prof. Pollalis</h2>
		<p>CS 115 discusses the "basic technologies" that allow for things such as 
		Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to exist. I'm also learning to write code
		in HTML, CSS, and (eventually) JavaScript. Though sometimes challenging,
		I love the sense of accomplishment I feel when I understand a concept or 
		the code I write renders the way I expected.
		</p>
			
	
	<h2 class="coursesf2017">AFR 265 with Prof. Cudjoe</h2>
		<p>In AFR 265, I get to read the autobiographies of well known African-American
		figures and explore the elements that makes up the African-American 
		experience. It's a lot of reading and discussion (this class meets for 
		2.5 hours once a week) involved, but I enjoy reading about other people's
		lives.
		</p>
			
		
	<h2 class="coursesf2017">LAT 200 with Prof. Starr</h2>
		<p>I took Latin in high school and liked it enough to want to continue
		studying it in college. In this class, we're reviewing all the major 
		grammar and constructions of the language as well as reading Latin texts
		such as Res Gestae. Though continuing Latin in college has been enjoyable,
		I'm excited to be finishing up my language requirement.
		</p>
