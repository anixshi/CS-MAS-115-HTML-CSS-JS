	<p>Hi everyone! ☺️ Welcome to my first page. Here, 
	you'll learn a little more about me such as where I was born,
	the classes I'm taking this semester, my aspirations, as well as 
	some of my <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>.</p>

<!--
Getting into information about myself such as basic info, fall semester schedule,
why I'm taking CS 115, and my aspirations as the assignment requests for me to do. 
-->

	<h2>Basic Information</h2>
	<ul class="centList">
		<li class="centList">Born and raised in 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut">Hartford, CT</a>,
			but most of my family is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">the best island</a>
			in the West Indies.
		<li class="centList">Born March 25 (I'm 19. And yes, I'm an Aries!)
		<li class="centList">Youngest of three (I have an older brother and sister)
		<li class="centList">Sophomore at <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/">Wellesley College</a>
			<ul>
			<li><i>(Major TBD)</i></li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<h2><a href="courses.html">Fall 2017 Semester Schedule</a></h2>
		<ul class="centList">
			<li class="centList">ARTH 100</li>
			<li class="centList">AFR 265</li>
			<li class="centList">LAT 200</li>
			<li class="centList">CS 115</li>
		</ul>
		
		
	<h2>Why CS 115?</h2>
		<p>I'm taking CS 115 because I (for now) want to major in 
		Media Arts and Sciences and it's a pre-requisite for the major. 
		I'm also interested in learning more about the fundamentals
		of computer science and how computers affect society today.</p>
			
	<h2>Aspirations</h2>
		<p>I see myself doing work in (and with) social media in the near future. 
		Ideally, I would like to work for a magazine or online publication like 
		<a href="https://blavity.com/">Blavity</a> where I'm creating content 
		about the topics I'm interested in, whether it be through blog posts, 
		articles or even videos. I have an interesting perspective and I feel
		the world should know about it.</p>
