Homework Assignments for CS/MAS 115: Computing for the Socio-Techno World (Fall 2017)

From course website:
"CS115 is for students who want a broad exposure to the fundamental concepts 
of computer science, but also for those that may want to major in Media Arts 
and Sciences (cross-listed as MAS115). Students get hands-on programming 
experience building Web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Given 
that most people experience the Web today using computer technologies from 
online networks (Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, etc), the technical topics 
are explored along with the social aspects of computing. We study the 
structure of the Social Web, and focus on a variety of cyberspace issues 
such as information availability, personal and group privacy, online security, 
critical thinking, online propaganda and manipulation, restricted resources, 
self-perception, and decision-making. No prior knowledge of computing is assumed."
